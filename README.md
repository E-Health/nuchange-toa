# Nuchange Transfer of Accountability

> Transfer of accountability (ToA) is the exchange of patient information during shift handovers by nurses. It is of vital importance in patient safety. However, not many dedicated software solutions exist at present to improve this process. ToA forms are typically displayed on computers or smartboards in multiple areas. Concurrency is maintained by Websockets. 

## How to install:
Nuchange ToA is developed using MEAN stack. 
1. Install npm, grunt, and Git
2. Git Clone master to a folder and cd to that folder.
3. npm install 
4. grunt serve
5. Add .PNG icons to client->assets->images with names male-01.png to male-05.png and female-01.png to female-05.png
